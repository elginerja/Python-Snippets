# Create a distance travled calculator
" distance = speed (miles_per_hour) * time (hour) "
# Calculate distance in each scenario
# Calculate the distance it will travel in 6 hours
distance1 = 70 * 6
# Calculate the distance it will travel in 10 hours
distance2 = 70 * 10
# Calculate the distance it will travel in 15 hours
distance3 = 70 * 15
# Show the different distances
